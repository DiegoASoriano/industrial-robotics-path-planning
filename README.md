# industrial-robotics-path-planning
This repository documents the implementation of high-precision robotic trajectories using two industrial platforms: KUKA (KRL) and Staubli (VAL3). The projects focus on two critical manufacturing applications: automated arc welding simulation and high-speed pick-and-place logistics.
